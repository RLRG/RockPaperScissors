# RockPaperScissors
This project was developed for the course "Objective-C for Swift developers" included in the iOS Developer Nanodegree from Udacity.

The main purpose of the course is to revise the basic concepts of Objective-C focusing on the differences and similarities with Swift so that the app is very simple: it is a RockPaperScissors game.

## Logic
Rock-paper-scissors (also known as paper, rock, scissors or paper, scissors, stone) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand. These shapes are "rock" (a simple fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V). A zero-sum game, it has only two possible outcomes other than a tie: one of the two players wins, and the other player loses.
